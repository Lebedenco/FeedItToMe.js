# FeedItToMe.js
### A Discord bot that sends you messages whenever there's an update on your favorite YouTube channels, podcasts, or whatever uses a RSS feed.
          
A verification is made every 5 minutes. If there is an update, a message is sent to the specified Discord channel containing the name, date and link of the last entry.

You can add and remove entries with "!add" and "!remove";

Clear the chat with "!clear";

And check the last entry for a single feed with "!check Feed Name"

A .json configuration file is needed for this to run, you can find a "Feed Example.json" file here.
